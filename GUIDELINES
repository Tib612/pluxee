## Code format
Code is auto-formatted on commit with Pants.
But it breaks everything on commit and undo all yout code changes... So don't install the pre-commit !!
```bash
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files --show-diff-on-failure
```

## Tests
```bash
python3 -m pytest --cov=pluxee-api --cov-report term-missing
```


## Tox
Run tox will
- run the tests
- run flake 8
- run mypy
On multiple python version if you have them installed.

Tox will also run with github actions on multiple python version and multiple OS.
```bash
tox
```
